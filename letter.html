    <p>                    
   today feels so special because it’s the very first birthday of yours that i get to celebrate with you. i had so much fun making this little thing for you, and i hope you love it as much as i loved putting my heart into it.  you always make me feel appreciated, cared for, and so loved. i can only hope to return all of that to you—especially today. you deserve all the good things this world has to offer, and i’ll keep doing my best to give you that piece by piece.

i’m so in love with you and i’m endlessly grateful for you. this is only the beginning, and i can’t wait to celebrate countless more birthdays together until we’re old and gray. i know i can’t spoil you as much as i’d like to this year, but i promise i’ll make it up to you on your future birthdays—tenfold.

for now, let me spoil you with endless hugs, kisses, and all the love i can possibly give.

happy birthday again, my love. may your day be as wonderful as you are. mwaaah 🤍

with love,
@yourlove
